# Collaboration Terms & Credits

## Logistical

- We plan on being available for communication about an hour after our lecture ends, allowing us a break before we dive into our work. We'll use Slack as our main platform for staying connectedâ€”it's convenient for sharing messages and files. As for breaks, we'll take them whenever necessary to stay fresh and focused. If we start to fall behind, our plan is to communicate openly with each other, push through as much as we can, and make use of available resources to catch up efficiently.

## Cooper

### How we can leverage each other's strengths and areas of development in the development of our application:

**Strengths**:

- Wajiha is proficient in JavaScript and React libraries
- Demarquies is proficient in troubleshooting and resource utilization.

**Utilizing Strengths**:

- Wajiha will implement JavaScript and React functionalities for the application.
- Demarquies will focus on troubleshooting and leveraging resources effectively.

**Areas for Development**:

- Wajiha seeks to enhance skills in Bootstrap and CSS for responsive design.
- Demarquies aims to improve understanding of data flow and APIs.

**Day-to-Day Approach**:

- Regular discussions to share updates and discuss challenges.
- Collaborative learning sessions to ensure everyone understands the codebase.
- Involve both team members in seeking help from TAs or external resources.

By structuring our approach this way, we can maximize productivity, address skill development goals, and foster a supportive learning environment within our team.

## Conflict Resolution

### How we will approach the following scenarios and challenges:

**Handling Unequal Contribution**:

If one team member is carrying most of the workload while the other is not contributing adequately, consider the following:

- Open Communication: Have an honest discussion about workload distribution and expectations.
- Reassess Roles: Adjust responsibilities based on strengths and interests to ensure a more balanced contribution.
- Seek Assistance: If communication doesn't resolve the issue, involve a third party like John or a TA to mediate and provide guidance on equitable collaboration.

**Addressing Dominant Project Control**:

If one member is taking over the project and not allowing the other to contribute effectively:

- Frequent Communication: Continuously discuss project direction, tasks, and roles.
- Establish Boundaries: Clearly define responsibilities and encourage shared decision-making.
- Involve Mediators: If necessary, bring in a neutral third party like John or a TA to facilitate discussions and ensure fair participation.

**Navigating Skill and Understanding Differences**:

Given varying skill levels and understanding, approach building the application with the following strategies:

- Open Communication: Discuss individual skill levels and learning needs to set realistic goals.
- Plan Together: Collaboratively outline tasks and milestones based on each person's capabilities.
- Support and Learning: Be ready to seek help when needed and offer assistance to bridge knowledge gaps.

By prioritizing open communication, setting clear expectations, and leveraging external support when necessary, our team can overcome challenges and build a successful application while promoting a balanced and supportive working environment.
